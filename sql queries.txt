1.Cities frequently visited?

select v.city_id_visited ,count(*) as visit_count ,c.city_name  from visit v, city c
where c.city_id = v.city_id_visited 
group by v.city_id_visited,c.city_id  
order by visit_count desc limit 1

2.Customers visited more than 1 city?

select count(*) as visit_customer ,c.customer_name  from visit v, customer c 
where c.customer_id  = v.customer_id 
group by v.customer_id ,c.customer_id  
having  count(*) > 1 

3.Cities visited breakdown by gender?

select c.customer_name ,c.gender ,c2.city_name  from customer c ,visit v ,city c2

order by c.gender 

4.List the city names that are not visited by every customer and order them by the expense budget in ascending order?

select * from city where city_id  not in (select city_id_visited from visit v) order by expence

5.Visit/travel Percentage for every customer?

with t1 as
(select customer_id ,count(*) as tv from visit  group by customer_id)
select customer_id ,tv , (0.0+tv)/(select count(*) as tc from customer c) * 100 as per
from t1

1002	1	25.00000000000000000000
1004	1	25.00000000000000000000
1001	2	50.00000000000000000000

6. Total expense incurred by customers on their visits?

select sum(c.expence),c2.customer_name  from city c, visit v, customer c2 
where c.city_id  = v.city_id_visited  and c2.customer_id = v.customer_id 
group by v.customer_id ,c2.customer_name 

7.list the Customer details along with the city they first visited and the date of visit?

select * from (select c2.customer_name ,v.date_visited,c.city_name  from  visit v, customer c2 ,city c

group by c2.customer_name ,v.date_visited ,c.city_name )as ab 
where ab.date_visited in (select min(v.date_visited) from visit v group by v.customer_id)
